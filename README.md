# civicrm-539-wp-content-fix

As described in [this issue](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/-/issues/107), the WordPress plugin for WordPress changed in version 5.39 to
avoid an issue that some users were seeing, ie the CiviCRM output was appearing twice. This change breaks some sites with various CiviCRM pages
only displaying the default CiviCRM WordPress page: "Do not delete this page. Page content is generated by CiviCRM." 
This plugin reverses this change, so install it if you see this problem.

In CiviCRM for WordPress, the "the_content" filter over-writes the default output with the (cached) CiviCRM output, eg the contribution page HTML.
In 5.39.0, the CiviCRM filter is removed during its first run - see [`basepage_render`](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/blob/master/includes/civicrm.basepage.php#L523) -
so subsequent calls to get "the_content" do not return the expected output. 
This plugin changes the functality back to pre-5.39.0 by ensuring that the CiviCRM content is returned for every call to the "the_content" filter.

The code in `civicrm_539_wp_content_fix_basepage_handler()` is run for every WordPress page at priority 20 (ie after the CiviCRM equivalent 
`basepage_handler()` in `civicrm.basepage.php`). The code removes the CiviCRM "the_content" filter and installs its own ie
`civicrm_539_wp_content_fix_basepage_render()`.  When this is run, it calls the CiviCRM handler `basepage_render()` and returns the given HTML.
Note that the CiviCRM `basepage_render()` will try to remove itself as a filter but this will be ignored by WordPress.
